# üõ°Ô∏è ThreatScan - SOC Automation Toolkit

A Python-based automation toolkit that streamlines common SOC analyst tasks, combining threat intelligence enrichment and simple incident response actions. For example, create a script or small web app that takes an indicator (IP address, domain, or file hash) from an alert and automatically queries multiple threat intelligence sources (e.g. VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Shodan) to gather reputation data and context‚Äã.
The tool can then output a consolidated report with details like malicious score, geolocation of an IP, domain WHOIS info, or related threat intel hits. Additionally, develop an automation to perform a response action: for instance, a Python script to quarantine a host or block an IP by interfacing with a firewall or cloud security group API.

### üîç Features

- Multi-source intel (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Shodan, OTX)
- Risk scoring with context-based logic
- Automatic submission to AlienVault OTX
- Color-coded CLI output
- JSON log generation
